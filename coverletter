Hello,

I'm interested in the Software Engineer position with the Center for Web and Data Science. I think I'd be a good fit for this position as I have several years of programming experience (hobbyist, academic research, and industry). In addition, I'm about to graduate from UW with a math PhD, so I have quantitative experience and an ability to digest technical subjects quickly. I also have experience writing technical papers and giving talks. Finally, I know some machine learning and big data, and am able to work in this area.

I'd like to talk and see if the position is a good fit.

Best,

James Pfeiffer
